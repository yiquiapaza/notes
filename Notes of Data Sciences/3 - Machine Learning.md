# Machine Learning

Utilize artificial intelligence to predict behavior in unprecedented ways.

Creating an algorithm, which a computer then uses to find a model that fits the data as best as possible. And make very accurate predictions based on that. The different of Traditional Methods is the Machine Learning we don't need give the machine instructions on how to find that model, we priveded with algorithms which give the machine directions in how learn on its own.

Machine Learning is a **TRIAL-AND-ERROR PROCESS**, each consecutive trial is at least as good as the previous one.

There are some thing very importans: **DATA, MODEL, OBJECTIVE FUNCTION AND OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM**.

## Training your model

* NO set of rules.
* No use instructions.
* Just a final goal.

For example you have 100 000 tries -> it may have learned how to be the best in something you try out there. 9/10 is a good level of accuracy.

* model : trained.
* odjective function : minimized.
* optimazation algorithm : has done its job.

## Benefit ML

That robot can learn more effectively that a human! And **USE** for impove complex computational models.

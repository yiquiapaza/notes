# INTRODUCCTION OF DATA SCIENCES

Buisteness Analytics
Data Analytics
Data Science
Business Intelligence
Maching Learning

Differents  between Analysis and Analytics
there is a lack  of a transparent understanding of both

## Analysis

examine each one part for separete, analysis something in the past, and try to explaned How and Why this happend
Qualitative Analysis => explaend how and why
Quantitative Analysis => how decreased and increments something

Preliminary data report is the first step of any data analysis
work with past data

### Business Intelligence (BI)

Is the process of analysing and reporting historial business data(BI Dashboard)
Aims to explain past event using business data, is the preliminary step of predictive analytics 
1 analyse post data and extract useful insights
2 create appropriate models 

reporting with visuals and create dashboard

## Analytics

examine the result for acctions and expriments. Looking for patterns and exploned what you can doing in the future
Qualitative Analytics => intuition(experience) + analysis(planed next business) 
Quantitative Analytics => formulas + algorithms for analysis , prediction of results
work with future prediction

### Machine Learning (ML)

The ability of machines to predict outcomes without being explicitly programmend
ML is about creating and implementing algoriths that let machines receive data and use this data to:

*Make predictions
*Analyse patterns
*Give recommendations

ML cannot implemented without data, appying machine learnig tools to the context of business intellegence 
ML helps develop models that predict what a client's next purchase would be
some examples are, Speech recognition, image recognition

### Aritificial Intelligence (AI)

Simulating human knowledge and decision making with computers
"We, as humans, have only managed to reach IA through machine learning"
